        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and olive oil. Cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Cook ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with a thin layer of sauce. Layer 3 lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread about 1/3 ricotta cheese mixture over noodles. Sprinkle about 1/4 mozzarella cheese over ricotta cheese mixture. Ladle about 1/3 meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, finishing with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts and sauce bubbles, about 90 minutes. Cover lasagna with foil if cheese begins to get too dark. Let sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
